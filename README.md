# Å-Blog
Å Blog -- A minimal markdown based blog in PHP

To add a post:

Create a file in the content directory with the filename YYYY-MM-DD+Blog_Post_Name.md, see test posts for examples.

That's it. Just put these PHP files on your server and you're good to go.


This code is pretty bad, but should work for a minimal blog application where only basic php is available.
